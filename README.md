# Nested Neural Networks for Medical Image Segmentation

It is written in Python and powered by the Keras deep learning framework (Tensorflow as backend).

using the following backbone network architectures:

- [ResNeXt{50,101,152}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)
- [ResNet{50,101,152}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
- [Feature Pyramid Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144) (with ResNet/ResNeXt)
- [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

Additional backbone architectures may be easily implemented.
