# Nested Neural Networks for Medical Image Segmentation

This is an implementation of Nest-Net in Python and powered by the Keras deep learning framework (Tensorflow as backend).

using the following backbone network architectures:

- [ResNet-101](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
- [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

Additional backbone architectures may be easily implemented.
